This project shows the impact of economic, social and military activities on stocks of selected companies in the Warsaw Stock Exchange. 

I have took five companies that have shares at the Warsaw Stock Exchange:

-Osama Bin Laden Death in 2011


-Embargo of Iranian fuels in 2018


-Financial crysis in 2008
